bug reproduction of following issue
http://code.google.com/p/flyway/issues/detail?id=287


how to reproduce:
mvn clean install
cd flyway-jws
mvn cargo:run
javaws http://localhost:8080/flyway-jws/webstart/flyway.jnlp



after applying patch
mvn clean install -P-MediumTests -pl flyway-core -am
in the flyway pom <flyway.version>1.7</flyway.version> change it to <flyway.version>1.8-SNAPSHOT</flyway.version>
mvn clean install
javaws -uninstall
cd flyway-jws
javaws http://localhost:8080/flyway-jws/webstart/flyway.jnlp
cd ../flyway-client
mvn exec:exec
cd ../flyway/jar-exec
mvn exec:exec

please look at the log file ${java.io.tmpdir}/flyway.log to see how for different types of classpath scanning are resolved
- jws is agains jar:http:
- flyway-client is agains file:
- flyway-jar-exec is agains jar:

patch is implemented based on org.springframework.core.io.support.PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver in spring-core-3.1.2.RELEASE.jar
look at protected Set<Resource> doFindPathMatchingJarResources(Resource rootDirResource, String subPattern) throws IOException

LocationScanner could take original URL, so I don't have to build it once again, but it requires refactoring of ClassPathScanner
